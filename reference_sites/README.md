[Telemetry Data Mapper utility](https://github.com/cisco-ie/tdm)
Telemetry Data Mapper is a tool to map data identifiers from SNMP, gRPC, NETCONF, CLI, etc. to each other.

TDM provides an offline, immutable view into advertised data availability from data models, with search affordance to quickly identify data of interest and the capability to map between data to aid in keeping track of what is roughly equivalent to what.

[Network Anamoly Data Sets](<https://github.com/cisco-ie/telemetry>)

Open-source datasets for anyone interested in working with network anomaly based machine learning, data science and research

The datasets released in this website are also instrumental to reproduce results that are published in [ACM SIGCOMM BigDama'18] and that are demonstrated at [IEEE INFOCOM'18] (see the Reference section below)

This repository only contains the dataset, whereas related repositories contain

- our generic DenStream implementation <https://github.com/anrputina/OutlierDenStream>
- specific instruction and code to replicate the paper results <https://github.com/anrputina/OutlierDenStream-BigDama18>
