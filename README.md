# NADT-Guide
> A community driven guide for the network engineering and operations community to share their knowledge on network
anatomy, diagnostics and treatment.

Much of the knowledge around network operations, data relatioships and dependencies, exists as tribal knowledge and is not generally available or documented outside of smaller groups of network oerators and engineers in the same administrative domain and organizations. Community contribution is important to ensure ownership and commitment to provide sustainability and growth of knowledge, capabilities and innovation. As a result, the need to share and document this knowledge has resulted in the development of this community driven repository. 

Cross science perspectives and methodologies around telemetry, data analytics, diagnostic and remediation that have not been considered within industry by any vendor or customer and are highly innovative.  The perspectives in play come from the BioMedical field specifically around use of homeostasis methodologies.  Homeostasis is the properties of a system in which variables are regulated so internal conditions remain stable and relatively constant.  It is processes that maintain the stability of the systemâ€™s internal environment in response to changes brought on be external conditions.
